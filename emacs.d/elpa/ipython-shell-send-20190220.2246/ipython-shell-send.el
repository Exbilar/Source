;;; Commentary:

;; This is a package for sending code to the IPython interpreter.
;; It provides functionality similar to the `python-shell-send-*'
;; functions in python.el, but is able to send code regions
;; containing IPython magic (such as `!ls' or `%timeit'),
;; whereas python.el only has limited support for this.
;; In addition, the final result of executed ipython regions
;; are printed, as in Jupyter cell evaluation.
;;
;; The functions provided by ipython-shell-send are
;; `ipython-shell-send-region', `ipython-shell-send-buffer',
;; and `ipython-shell-send-defun'. They are essentially equivalent
;; to their `python-shell-send-*' equivalents in `python.el',
;; except better able to handle IPython magic.
;;
;; Note to use the ipython-shell-send, you must make sure
;; to start an IPython shell when calling `run-python'.
